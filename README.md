# CInfoWaveGAN

An architecture for modeling lexical learning from raw acoustic inputs called Categorical InfoWaveGAN that combines Deep Convolutional GAN architecture for audio data (WaveGAN) with categorical variables in information theoretic proposal InfoGAN.

Based on WaveGAN (https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan) and InfoGAN (https://github.com/singnet/semantic-vision/blob/master/experiments/concept_learning/gans/info-wgan-gp/10_originfo_sepQ_v2_lr1e-3/train.py).
